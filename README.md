# PuzzlePieces

(the module pygame is required to use it correctly)

This program works like a puzzle game.
When you run the python file, a window opens with an image on top
and parts of that image on both sides.
You have to click on those images in the RIGHT ORDER to complete 
the image (it will appear on the middle).
